# dotfiles
My dotfiles for tmux and neovim. I mainly use it to get neovim+tmux and some bash aliases.

# If you want to install it for some reason
Clone the repo to your home directory

``` git clone https://github.com/civanakbas/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles ```

Run the install script

``` ./install.sh ```

``` :PlugInstall ``` for neovim plugins.

``` C-a ``` + ``` I ``` for tmux plugins.
